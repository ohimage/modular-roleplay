# NeoRP Beta #
## Introduction ##
NeoRP is a garrysmod 13 gamemode designed with modularity and code clarity in mind. All aspects of the gamemode are designed to be easy to modify and customise to any server's needs. The gamemode it self is similar to other roleplay gamemodes such as DarkRP. The main differences are in the code structure and some features.

## What is Different? ##
  1. NeoRP contains an advanced module system with an XML formated header for every module which tells the loader what to do with it. This system can be used to specify requirements and if it runs on client, server, or shared.
  1. NeoRP uses an advanced gamemode hook system which groups all of the gamemode's hooks together and calls them like a second hook system. This allows for modules to add their own handlers for events.
  1. NeoRP's advanced datamanagment Libraries provide an easy to use interface with the SQL database that allows users to easily add columns for their own data.
